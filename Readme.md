## **Gameplay Instructions**

### **Game Rules**

#### **Simple Board Rules** (Applicable to Modes 1 and 2)
1. The game is played on a standard 3x3 TicTacToe board.
2. Players alternate turns, placing their symbols (X or O) on the board.
3. A player wins by aligning three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
4. The game ends in a draw if all cells are filled and no player wins.

#### **Nested Board Rules** (Applicable to Modes 3 and 4)
1. The game is played on a 3x3 main board where each cell contains a 3x3 mini-board.
2. Players alternate turns, placing their symbols (X or O) on the mini-boards:
    - **Winning a Mini-Board:** A player captures a mini-board by aligning three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally within that board.
    - **Capturing the Main Board:** The main board is updated when a player wins a mini-board. The player takes control of the corresponding cell on the main board.
3. A player wins the game by capturing three cells in a row on the main board (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
4. If the main board is completely filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

### **Game Modes**

#### **Mode 1: Simple**
- Standard gameplay on a single 3x3 board.
- No AI involvement, strictly two-player gameplay.

#### **Mode 2: Simple vs AI**
- Standard gameplay on a single 3x3 board.
- Player 1 competes against an AI opponent. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal decisions.

#### **Mode 3: Strategic**
- Players are restricted to playing on a mini-board corresponding to the position of the previous playerâ€™s move on the main board.
    - Example: If Player 1 places a mark in position 7 of a mini-board, Player 2 must play on mini-board 7.
- If the corresponding mini-board is already won or drawn, the player can choose any other valid mini-board.

#### **Mode 4: Randomized**
- The mini-board for the next turn is randomly selected after every move.
- Mini-boards that are already completed (won or drawn) are excluded from the randomization pool.
